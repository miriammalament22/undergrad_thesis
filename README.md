# Returns to Education and Human Capital Investment: The Argentine Case

## Description

This repository contains the code and related files for the project titled "**Returns to Education and Human Capital Investment: The Argentine Case**." Originally completed for the Economic Development course, this project later served as my undergraduate thesis. It was subsequently published as a working paper in the Asociación Argentina de Economía Política (AAEP) and presented at the 2023 conference.

## Repository Structure

- **Código/**: Folder containing scripts and files needed for data analysis. Includes the `returns_to_education.R` file, which contains the main code for the analysis.
- **Figuras/**: Images and charts generated during the analysis.
- **Output/**: Processed results, reports, and other output files generated from the code scripts.
- **Paper/**: Contains the final version of the paper in PDF format (`Trabajo Final Desarrollo Económico.pdf`) and the draft file in R Markdown format (`development_draft.Rmd`) used for writing the document.

## Main Files

- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the repository.
- `Trabajo Final Desarrollo Económico.pdf`: Final document of the project that includes the complete analysis.
- `development_draft.Rmd`: Draft of the paper in R Markdown format.
- `returns_to_education.R`: R script for analyzing returns to education in Argentina.

## Data Source

This project uses data from the **Encuesta Permanente de Hogares (EPH)**, which is a household survey in Argentina. The EPH dataset is available through the National Institute of Statistics and Censuses (**INDEC**). The analysis utilizes the `eph` library in R to access and manipulate this dataset effectively.

## Project Objective

This project analyzes the returns to education in terms of human capital investment in Argentina. Through data and econometric methods, it seeks to understand how education impacts economic development and human capital formation in the country.

## Requirements

To reproduce the analysis, the following dependencies are needed:

- **R** (recommended version 4.0 or higher)
- R packages:
  - `tidyverse` for data manipulation
  - `ggplot2` for visualization
  - `dplyr` for data operations
  - `readr` for data import
  - `eph` for accessing and processing EPH data
  - Other specific packages may be listed in the scripts.

## Usage Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/miriammalament22/repository-name.git
3. Open the `returns_to_education.R` file in RStudio or your preferred R environment.

4. Run the script to perform the analysis and generate results.

5. The `development_draft.Rmd` file can be compiled in RStudio to generate an updated version of the research document.
